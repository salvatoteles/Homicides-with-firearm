Here you find an example of estimation with LSTM for the different configurations of a certain month, november,
to get the predictions that the approach will produced at every november.

With the file "LSTM_pre", the estimations from november 2009,10,11 & 12 are obtained, when the series from Homicides from the three cities is the newest variable incorporated.
With the file "LSTM_mid", the estimations from november 2013,14,15 & 16 are obtained, when the series from Twitter is the newest variable incorporated.
